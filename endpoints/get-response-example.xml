                    Kais comment: An Academic Term is a general concept (usually a
                    semester, trimester or such) identified by start year + term.
                    (In this case, 2017/Spring)
                    The academic year starting Fall 2016 would consist of 2 Academic
                    Terms: 2016/Fall and 2017/Spring. (Non-key elements are removed,
                    as these are references)

                    Wojtek's comment: What about terms which start in 2016 and end in
                    2017? Also, I believe we have a bit different conventions in
                    Poland. We'd call such semester "Spring 2016/2017" since it is part
                    of the academic year which started in 2016.
                    
                    I would suggest <start-date>, <end-date>, <name> (all required).

                    Kais comment: Ah, we have a difference in terminology:
                    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_term defines an academic
                    term to be *part of a year* (semester => semi => half year etc).
                    The common academic year lasts for 2 terms (N Fall..N+1 Spring).
                    
                    As for including Start/End Date and Name: Since Academic Terms
                    used at a HEI are defined in the Institutions/Departments APIs, I
                    would think it was enough with a reference here (Year + Term Code)?

                    Mobility Type has the two components below, with the suggested values:
                    - mobility-group = Student or Staff
                    - mobility-category = Studies or Training
                    Where the combinations are:
                    - Student/Studies (self-explanatory)
                    - Student/Training (traineeships)
                    - Staff/Studies (teaching)
                    - Staff/Training (training)
                    I don't have strong opinions about the coding of these values.

                    Found it here: https://github.com/erasmus-without-paper/ewp-specs-api-iias/issues/1
                    My primary concern is wether we should allow for other (unknown) combinations for
                    future-compatibility.
